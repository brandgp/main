I am a Research Analyst at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where I contribute to the State and Local Governance Initiative. My work involves conducting empirical economic research, managing complex datasets, and producing policy-relevant insights on energy, innovation, and governance.

My academic background spans in the intersection between energy economics and public policy. I hold a Master’s in Energy Economics from Rice University as a Fulbright-García Robles Scholar and a B.A. in Public Policy from CIDE (Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas).

I have previously served as a research assistant in the Energy Economics Department at CIDE, a lecturer in the area of sustainable economic development, and a congressional intern working on regulatory reform. My research interests include energy market regulation, distributed energy technologies, and the economic evaluation of public policy using applied econometrics.
